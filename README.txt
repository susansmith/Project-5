Tybee Island Restaurants

To open: click index.html

This page displays a map of my favorite restaurants on Tybee Island, GA.

Clicking on a map marker will open an information window with a link to the restaurant's web page
	as listed in Foursquare.

Clicking on an item in the list will open the corresponding window on the map.

To narrow down the list of locations, type your criteria in the search box to filter by name.

**********************************
This project uses Google Maps API and Foursquare API

To build this project I reviewed Udacity's cat clicker project videos (multiple times!), the Foursquare
API documentation, and the Knockout.js documentation.  In the end it took a lot of trial and error and
console logging to see what worked and what didn't.
